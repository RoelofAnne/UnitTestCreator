Also rewriting the existing code to a more oo style and perhaps add a UI.\r\n\r\nImportant for me on this project is that mono developers as well as visualstudio developers can use it.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage: run the project with additional argument \"folder={solution}={test}\", where {solution} is the base of the solution tree and {test} is the location where the tree of testfiles is placed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease, feel free to contribute, give feedback and share ideas!\r\n",
