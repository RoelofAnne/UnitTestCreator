# UnitTestCreator
Creating unit tests for projects without tests can be really a pain, therefore I started this project.

Currently it is really basic and supports:

-- Nunit test style set up for VB.Net

There are plans to extend the console application to multiple test harnasses and multiple language. Also rewriting the existing code to a more oo style and perhaps add a UI.

Important for me on this project is that mono developers as well as visualstudio developers can use it.


Usage: run the project with additional argument "folder={solution}={test}", where {solution} is the base of the solution tree and {test} is the location where the tree of testfiles is placed.


Please, feel free to contribute, give feedback and share ideas!
