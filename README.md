# UnitTestCreator
Creating unit tests for projects without tests can be really a pain, therefore I started this project.

Currently it is really basic and supports:

* Nunit test style set up for VB.Net
* Nunit test style set up for CS.Net

There are plans to extend the console application to multiple test harnasses and multiple languages. Perhaps an UI, if any fancy to help me on this nice little project?

Important for me on this project is that mono developers as well as visualstudio developers can use it.

Usage: run the project with additional argument "folder={solution}={test}", where {solution} is the base of the solution tree and {test} is the location where the tree of testfiles is placed.

Please, feel free to contribute, give feedback and share ideas!
